Learn about generator functions
- Describe iterables series with code functions
- Are laze evaluated: the next value in the sequence is computed on demand
- cCan model infinite series/sequence: data streams, mathematical series with no end
- Can use pipelines (pipeline:output from one program can be taken as input to next program)
